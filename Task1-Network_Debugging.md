To troubleshoot a form submission failure using the browser’s developer tools, here're the steps I would follow:

1. Open Developer Tools: In most browsers, open the developer tools by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect".
	
2. Go to the Network Tab: This captures all network activity for the page, including requests made when submitting a form.

3. Clear Network Log: To make it easier to focus on the form submission, clear previous requests in the log.

4. Submit the Form: With the Network tab open, submit the form. Watch for any new requests that appear in the Network panel. The form submission request will typically be labeled as POST or GET, depending on the form method.

5. Inspect the Form Request: Locate the form request in the list and click on it. Here are the key areas to examine:
- Headers: Check the "Request Headers" to ensure they contain the expected values, such as "Content-Type" (e.g., application/json for JSON payloads).
- Payload: In the "Payload" or "Request" section, verify that the data sent from the form matches what you expect. Look for missing or incorrect form fields that could be causing the issue.
- Preview and Response Text: The "Preview" or "Response" tabs show more details if there is an error message returned by the server. It may contain an error message or status code (e.g., 400, 401, 500) that can help diagnose the issue.

6. Console Errors: If the network traffic doesn’t reveal the issue, check the Console tab for JavaScript errors that might prevent the form submission from going through correctly.

7. Verify Cross-Origin Requests: If the form submission makes a cross-origin request, check if the server allows it by reviewing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response. Missing or incorrect CORS headers can cause submission failures.

8. Retry and Observe Changes: After identifying potential issues and making adjustments, retry the form submission to see if the changes resolved the problem.
	
This systematic approach will help you identify the issue, whether it’s due to incorrect payload formatting, server errors, network timeouts, or client-side validation problems.
